1. RDBMS gets heavy with front end applications like angular and react
2. This is based on JS - java script which cannot connect to database
--------------
		3. Thus we needed more light weight database
		4. applications needed a flexible database

		RDBMS is a strongly typed database

		lossely typed database - also it has to be light weight

	---- JSON was already very famous for both of above

		thus someone came out with an idea to stre the json files as a database managmenet sysem
------------------------------------------------------------			
			MongoDB is 1 of them 

		1. so this is a NoSQL database and we have javascript based functions for CRUD operatons
		2. 


		RDBMS			NoSQL
		Tables			Collections
		SQL Language		JS Functions
		schema based		loosely typed
		select			
		insert
		update
		delete
-----------------------------------------------------------------------	
			directly try to use the object (db, collection, document etc..)
			if the object is present you will get connected to the object
		else, mongodb will create it for you and connect you to it

		eg use shoppingDB
