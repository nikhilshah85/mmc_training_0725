a. application has a lot of Code Smell
	means
		lots of variables, functions, properties, classname, connections etc....
			are not named correctely
		lots of varaibles are using wrong data types which leads to memory leek
		lots of open resoures in the application, not been closed
			eg. you opened the file but did not close it
				opening the connection to database but did not close it
				making a rest api calls, going to other servers									but did not terminate the connction
						all this things makes applications slow
		.jpg /png images are used, but are not minimized / jinxed in size making 			application slow

		same for .css files, .js file
		there are white spaces, comments, unwanted code, which you are sending to p			roduction

		application are still using non-minified files, which is wrong and makes 			applications 10 times slower
