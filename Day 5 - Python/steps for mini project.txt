1. in the training folder, create a new folder, mini project
2. create a folder users and admin
3. create a new python file to display 

when the application starts, it will print welcome to ~~~~~~~~~Citibank ~~~~~~~~~
a. admin
b. user

when user selects a, display welcome admin, please enter username, password and secret code
we will read this from the admin file

when the user selects b
we will ask accountnumber, (501)
username and password  - pwd@1234
pin - 1234
----------------
you know this is user 501,
he says withdraw 55000, ok
so balance will get updated in file 501, previous bal was 75,
	so now the file will have 75-55 - 20K is the new balance
