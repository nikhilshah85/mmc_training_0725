			Routing in React
	we want an internal navigation for components, within the client side

	1. by default, routing is not a part of react application, we have to install packages to enable
		routing 
	i.e react-router-dom


	lets do a simple example

	a. create a new application (react_routing_demo)
	b. clear the default content in app.js
	c. create 4 components
		home - display welcome home
		about display welcome about
		contact - display welcome contact
		login (add 2 text boxes and a login button)
	d. if you are running the application, stop the server, and inside the app folder
		npm install react-router-dom
