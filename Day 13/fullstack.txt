1.do a git pull from the training folder
2.check day 13 folder - there is a word file express_mongo
3.this code guides how to connect to mongodb using express
4. modify the code to use the shoppingDB database we used yesterday
5. modify the code to use the productsList collection and perform CRUD operations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
	 so we now know of, 
	 Backend - mongo
	 Middleware - express
	 frontend - angular
	 Platform - Node

----- lets complete the cycle
1. create a new angular application, shoppingApp in day 13
2. clear the app.html
3. create components, Home, about, products, addproduct, updateproduct, deleteproduct	
	a. product will display the list of product from database in a table format,
		it will make a call to express url and get the data
	b. add will have textboxes and form elements with a add button which will 
	c. similarly delete and update
4. create a service productService which will talk to api and intract between angular and express to work
	with data
