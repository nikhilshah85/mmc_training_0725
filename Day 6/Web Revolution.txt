	-----------------------------------------------------------------
		Google came up with Node - a very light weight web sever / compiler / transpiler
			for faster web

		and also gave us a language called AngularJS (till 1.7 they maintained it)
		based on design pattern - MVC 
----------------------------
		Facebook - they came up with a library called - React

----------------------------
		W3C - came up with HTML5, CSS3, ECMA Script which is OOPs based JavaScript
			but it is very difficult to learn and understand, not good for developer
			so Microsoft came forward and made it easy, like C# and Java codeing stying
					gave it a name as Typescript
---------------------------
		XML was made more lighter and faster with the help of JSON

---------------RDBMS is a strongly typed data - we wanted something loosely coupled
		thus a concept of NOSQL came up - and databases like MongoDB, Postgres, etc... came up

---short hand JavaScript / ecma script - Express

		Mongo (NoSQL) - backend
		Express - middleware (to create web api services) - webAPI in .net, spring in java
		Angular - frontend
		Node  - server
