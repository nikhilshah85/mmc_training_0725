					Services in Angular

1.Services are backbone of every angular application 
2.They are the code/function which runs in the background of the application (like antivirus)
3.There are 2 types of services
	a. in built in angular
		Routing (is used to create an SPA application in angular)
				SPA - Single paged application  
		HttpClient (is used to make API calls, to get, put, post and delete the data)

	b. a user defined services
4. services are also used to share data between 2 or more components
	eg. if you have a login component with username and password txt, 
			user will be providing the values and press the login, if the login is successful
		he/she will be navigated to the next page, lets say home, on this page we want to dspay 
	welcome the name enterd by the user in the login page
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Routing is used to create the SPA application 
		Thus we have a service which will enable us to create such app
